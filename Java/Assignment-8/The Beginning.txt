The journey started in the late 60’s. Krishna Das met spiritual seeker Ram Dass; he traveled across the country with Ram Dass as his student, captivated by the stories of his recent trip to India where he had met the legendary guru Neem Karoli Baba, known to most as Maharaj-ji.  Finally, following his heart, in August 1970, Krishna Das left behind his dreams of being a rock star and made his way to meet this remarkable Being. Basking in the love of Maharaj-ji in the three years that followed, KD’s heart was drawn to the practice of Bhakthi Yoga – the yoga of devotion and after two and a half years with Maharaj-ji, he returned to USA – alas, six months after his return, word came that Maharaj-ji had died.
“I will sing for you in the west” he had promised his beloved Guru in his own heart. This did not come easily. If you listen to KD in one of his many workshops or read his book ‘Chants of a Life Time’ you will know that it took almost 20 years for KD to sing with groups of people around the USA. In his book Chants of a life time, KD writes about his journey over all the years.
